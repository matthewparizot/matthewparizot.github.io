# Golfer in Chief
#### Is the new president's golfing habit any worse than his peers?

As Donald Trump exits his 9th week as the 45th President of the United States, it’s clear that the Trump administration has proven itself to be every bit as controversial as it was expected to be. We haven’t even finished our third month, and President Trump has already managed to nominate a Russian collaborator as a national security advisor, botch a raid in Yemen, and invent a wiretapping scandal. This isn’t even mentioning the failures that were both of Trump’s Muslim bans and his repeal of Obamacare.

However, there’s one controversy that, despite seeming benign, has just the right combination of irony and hypocrisy to catch any Trump-hater’s attention: Donald Trump, Real Estate Tycoon, Former Game Show Host, and President of the United States, plays a lot of golf.

Now for anyone who perhaps followed Trump’s career before his ascent to the highest office in elected government may have already known that Trump was an avid golfer. The website for one of this companies, Trump Golf, boasts 18 “world-class golf destinations across the globe”. Golf Digest released a special edition issue with an illustration of Trump and the words “Golfer in Chief” placed on the cover. It’s no secret that this man loves to golf.

So is it really an issue if Trump likes to take a trip to his golf resort in Florida to hit a few holes? By all intents and purposes, you might think the Democrats would appreciate any time Trump takes away from trying to pass other morally evil executive order. This could have possibly been the case, if it weren’t for Trump’s Twitter account.

Trump was very active on Twitter before he became president, and he hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down since he became elected. While Trump Twitter fingers have gotten him in trouble several times already, it’s his tweets from back when Obama was president that have come back to haunt him.

Author Brian Klass put together a tweet combining all of Donald Trump’s tweets criticizing Obama for playing golf while he was President. Most of them play on some variation of Obama avoiding a new presidential crisis by playing golf instead of doing his job. The tweet has gone viral since it was posted in February, and has been retweeted over 40,000 times.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump has golfed two weekends in a row (out of 4 as president).<br><br>Here are 11 times Trump criticized Obama for playing golf as President. <a href="https://t.co/MTeinCAi1S">pic.twitter.com/MTeinCAi1S</a></p>&mdash; Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/830565403361304576">February 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

As such, Trump being seen golfing so much has been relatively damaging to his credibility. Not only does it seem lazy and unprofessional, but his weekly trips to his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida is running up quite a tab for the tax payers. It’s gotten to the point where right-wing news outlets like Fox News have been forced to blatantly lie about Trump’s whereabouts to make it seem like he’s golfing less than he is. Not to mention that he's still far behind other presidents in terms of how much golf he's playing.

Over all, while it may be fun to make fun of Trump for skirting his responsibility and for being a hypocrite, none of this will have any impact when it comes to fighting Trump’s policies or working to stop his re-election in 2020. The Democrats want to turn their criticisms inward and ask themselves if they’re choosing the easy path, just as Trump is.
